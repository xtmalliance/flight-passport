        <h4>Identity and Authentication for Unmanned Aviation</h4>
        <p>This is a production instance of <a href="https://github.com/openskies-sh/flight_passport/">Flight Passport</a>. Flight Passport is a OAUTH / OpenID Connect server used to authenticate and issue credentials in the form of JWT tokens to access different U-Space / UTM services.</p>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>The upcoming U-Space and UTM ecosystem and the associated standards, use JWT Tokens and OAUTH 2.0 technology to authenticate users and services. This is a open-source implementation of OAUTH 2.0 server built specifically for UTM / U-Space. It supports the <mark>Client Credentials</mark> flow for Machine to Machine interactions and the <mark>Authorization Code</mark> flow for cases where an individual / person is associated via the Open ID connect standard. In addition, it supports most existing Identity and Authentication platforms if you want to link it to them.</p>
        <h4>What can I do with a Token?</h4>
        <p><a href="https://jwt.io">Javascript Web Tokens (JWT)</a> is the technology that is used as a mechanism for exchanging credentials across U-Space / UTM. Using a JWT token issued by this server, you can connect to for example, a DSS instance, use it for applications like <a href="https://flightspotlight.com">Flight Spotlight</a>, <a href="https://flightblender.com">Flight Blender</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/interuss/dss">DSS</a> and across many other applications and serivice providers for UTM and U-Space. Importantly, you can self-host this software to issue your own tokens securely and conduct analysis against it.</p>
